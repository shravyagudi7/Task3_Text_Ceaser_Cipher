# Introduction
The Caesar Cipher is a simple and ancient encryption technique that involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions. This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing both encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher.

# Features
Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.
User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.
Error handling for invalid shift values.
Customizable shift value for encryption and decryption.


# Requirements
    -Python 3.x
    -Tkinter (included in Python's standard library)
